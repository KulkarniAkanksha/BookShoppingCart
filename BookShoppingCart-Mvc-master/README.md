## How to run the project?üåê

I am assuming that, you have already installed **Visual Studio 2022** (It is the latest as of march,2024) and **MS SQL Server Management Studio** (I am using mssql server 2022 as of march,2024). Now, follow the following steps.

1.Open command prompt. Go to a directory where you want to clone this project. Use this command to clone the project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rd003/BookShoppingCart-Mvc
```

2.Go to the directory where you have cloned this project, open the directory `BookShoppingCart-Mvc`. You will find a file with name `BookShoppingCartMvc.sln`. Double click on this file and this project will be opened in Visual Studio.

3.Open `appsettings.json` file and update connection string

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "conn": "data source=your_server_name;initial catalog=MovieStoreMvc; integrated security=true;encrypt=false"
}
```

4.Delete `Migrations` folder.

5.Open Tools > Package Manager > Package manager console

6.Run these 2 commands (works only with Visual studio)

```bash
  add-migration init

  update-database
```

7.Now you can run this project.

## How to register as admin and login?? üßë‚Äçüíªüßë‚Äçüíª

1.Open the `Program.cs` file , you will find these commented lines

```c#
//using(var scope = app.Services.CreateScope())
//{
//    await DbSeeder.SeedDefaultData(scope.ServiceProvider);
//}
```

Uncomment these line and run the project. `Now stop the project and comment these lines again.`

2.Now click on login and login with these credentials.

```text
username: admin@gmail.com

password: Admin@123
```

## Data Entry üìàüìâ

I have provided some data of these 3 tables to test the application.

**‚ö†Ô∏èNote: Data entry of Genre and Book is optional, you can do it from admin panel but you must enter some data for OrderStatus.**

- Genre (You can also add it from the admin panel)
- Book (You can also add it from the admin panel)
- OrderStatus (‚ö†Ô∏èIt Contain Constants. You Can not enter OrderStatus from the Admin panel. It must be added through sql server)

Please, run these scripts in a order. Genre data must be added before book.




## Other useful sql scripts

You also need to add this stored procedure in your database.

```sql
create  procedure [dbo].[Usp_GetTopNSellingBooksByDate]
@startDate datetime,@endDate datetime
as
begin

SET NOCOUNT ON;

with UnitSold as
(
select od.BookId, SUM(od.Quantity) as TotalUnitSold from [order] o 
join OrderDetail od on o.Id = od.OrderId
where o.IsPaid=1 and o.IsDeleted=0 and o.CreateDate between @startDate and @endDate
group by od.BookId
)

select top 5 b.BookName,b.AuthorName,b.[Image],us.TotalUnitSold 
from  UnitSold us
join [Book] b
on us.BookId = b.Id
order by us.TotalUnitSold desc
end
```
